# Banking MainFrame
Is just the kernel that most of the banking operations are executed on using COBOL like payments , accounts extra ... 

I have found that the banking system operations are very complecated and heavy thus they are using outdated technologies like COBOL that doesn't have much support with a small community .

so I will be building a terminal or a server that can perform some of the basic operations they do.

this is the articale I will base my developement on : [﻿advapay.eu/core-banking-what-is-evolution-key-components-types-challenges-opportunities/](https://advapay.eu/core-banking-what-is-evolution-key-components-types-challenges-opportunities/) 

The core components of the banking mainframe:

- Customer Onboarding: Manage clients - with security and regulations implemented like KYC and AML . account types are 'current' 'investement' 'savings'. all of the previous supporting Real-time .
- Transaction Processing: Card Payments, Internal Transfers , SWIFT, Local
- Card Issuing: Card life-cycle Management
